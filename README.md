# foundation6

This is a theme for the static site generator [Nikola](https://getnikola.com) using the [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com) framework.

It aims to be simple, elegant and not bloat the overall size of your site too much.

## Usage

Go to the root directory of your Nikola site.

Create the `themes` folder in case it is missing:

  mkdir themes


Clone the repository as `foundation6` into the folder:

  git clone git@github.com:okin/nikola-theme-foundation6.git themes/foundation6


In your conf.py set `THEME` to `foundation6`. 

Rebuild your site.
